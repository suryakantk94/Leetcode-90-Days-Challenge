Given a sorted array and a value x, the floor of x is the largest element in the array smaller than or equal to x. Write efficient functions to find the floor of x

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19}, x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 is the largest element in
arr[] smaller than 5

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19}, x = 20
Output: 19
Explanation: 19 is the largest element in
arr[] smaller than 20

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19}, x = 0
Output : -1
Explanation: Since floor doesnâ€™t exist, output is -1.
