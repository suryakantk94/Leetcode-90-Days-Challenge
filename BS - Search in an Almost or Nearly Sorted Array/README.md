Search in an almost sorted array

Given an array which is sorted, but after sorting some elements are moved to either of the adjacent positions, i.e., arr[i] may be present at arr[i+1] or arr[i-1]. Write an efficient function to search an element in this array. Basically the element arr[i] can only be swapped with either arr[i+1] or arr[i-1].

For example consider the array {2, 3, 10, 4, 40}, 4 is moved to next position and 10 is moved to previous position.

Example :
Input: arr[] = {10, 3, 40, 20, 50, 80, 70}, key = 40
Output: 2
Output is index of 40 in given array
